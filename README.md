# Eclair CLI

`eclair-cli` is a [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html) command-line application that lets you interact with your [eclair node](https://github.com/acinq/eclair).
It runs on the following desktop platforms:

- linux
- macOS

Note that Windows is not supported yet as [ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/native-server.html) doesn't have built-in support for Kotlin Native on Windows yet.

## Installation
